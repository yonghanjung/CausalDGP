## ðŸ“– Overview

**CausalDGP** is a Python engine for causal inference research and experimentation. It provides a robust framework for defining complex causal systems, generating data from them, and analyzing their underlying graphical properties.

While the engine is a general-purpose tool, it also serves as a comprehensive benchmark, providing a standardized collection of data generating processes (DGPs) from the causal inference literature. It's designed to help researchers evaluate and compare estimators under challenging scenarios, including:

* Back-door and front-door adjustment
* Unobserved confounding and complex "napkin" graphs
* Longitudinal models with time-varying treatments
* Advanced identification strategies beyond simple adjustments

---

## âœ¨ Key Features

The power of `CausalDGP` comes from its modular design:

* **Flexible SCM Engine (`scm.py`)**: Define any SCM by specifying variables, their causal parents, and their functional relationships. The engine handles the recursive data generation process automatically.
* **Rich Graph Toolkit (`graph.py`)**: A suite of utility functions for causal graph analysis, including d-separation checks, finding ancestors, implementing do-calculus rules, and generating interactive visualizations.
* **Benchmark Suite (`generator.py`)**: A ready-to-use collection of famous and challenging SCMs from the literature, perfect for evaluating new methods.


For detailed API documentation, please see our `docs/` folder (coming soon).

## ðŸš€ Quick Start: The Benchmark Application

The easiest way to see `CausalDGP` in action is through the included benchmark generators (`generator.py`). These pre-built SCMs from the literature demonstrate the capabilities of the engine.

### Setup

1.  Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install networkx scipy matplotlib numpy pandas pyvis
    ```
2.  Install `CausalDGP` as an editable package to ensure all imports work correctly.

### Example: Generating Data

You can import any SCM from the `generator` module and use it to create a dataset. Hereâ€™s how to generate 1,000 samples from the **Kang & Schafer (2007)** simulation:

```python
# 1. Import a pre-built SCM generator from the CausalDGP package
from CausalDGP.generator import Kang_Schafer

# 2. Get the SCM object, treatment, and outcome variable names
scm, treatments, outcomes = Kang_Schafer(seednum=42)

# 3. Use the SCM object to generate a pandas DataFrame
sample_data = scm.generate_samples(num_samples=1000)

# 4. Display the first few rows of your new dataset
print(sample_data.head())
```
